      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    `matplotlib.pyplot` is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides\n",
      "    an implicit,  MATLAB-like, way of plotting.  It also opens figures on your\n",
      "    screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    pyplot is mainly intended for interactive plots and simple cases of\n",
      "    programmatic plot generation::\n",
      "    \n",
      "        import numpy as np\n",
      "        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

      "        plt.plot(x, y)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The explicit (object-oriented) API is recommended for complex plots, though\n",
      "    pyplot is still usually used to create the figure and often the axes in the\n",
      "    figure. See `.pyplot.figure`, `.pyplot.subplots`, and\n",
      "    `.pyplot.subplot_mosaic` to create figures, and\n",
      "    :doc:`Axes API <../axes_api>` for the plotting methods on an axes::\n",
